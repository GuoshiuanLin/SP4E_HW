### Homework 3

### Running the program
Build the program as the following: 
```
cd SP4E_HW/HW3
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the tests
After building the program as explained in the previous step, it is possible to run the tests as following:

For the FFT transform test:
```
cd build
./test_fft
```
For the Kepler test:
```
cd build
./test_fft
```
For the Validating tests for 
4.2 - initial homogeneous temperature and no heat flux,
4.3 - volumetric heat source of a sinusoidal form,
4.4 - volumetric heat source of a linear form:
```
cd build
./test_temp
```
